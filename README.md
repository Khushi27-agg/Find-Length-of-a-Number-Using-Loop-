# Find-Length-of-a-Number-Using-Loop-
Day 11 of my daily coding challenge focuses on finding the length (number of digits) of an integer in C++. The program uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the number by 10 and count how many times this operation occurs until the number becomes zero.

# Features

Calculates the number of digits in an integer

Uses arithmetic operations only

Simple and efficient logic

Works for any positive integer input

Console-based user interaction

# Key Concepts Used

while loop

Integer division

Loop counters

Conditional checks

Console input/output

# Technologies Used

Language: C++

# Sample Output
Enter a number: 45678
Length of the number is: 5

# Learning Outcome

This task strengthened my understanding of number manipulation using loops in C++. It highlights how integer division by 10 removes digits one by one, making it an effective way to calculate the length of a number without converting it to a string.
